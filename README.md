# Introduction
TinyBack is an URL unshortener. There are way too many URL shorteners and way
too few URL unshorteners. Results from TinyBack runs can be found as a torrent
on [urlte.am](http://urlte.am).

# Requirements
While the original version was written in Ruby, a rewrite in 2012 changed that
to Python 2. There are no external dependencies, the standard library is all
you need.

# How to run TinyBack
TinyBack is meant to be run as a client for a tracker, which coordinates
archiving efforts. Tinyback also supports running as part of the [ArchiveTeam
Warrior](http://www.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=ArchiveTeam_Warrior)
infrastructure.
