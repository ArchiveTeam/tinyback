title: Don't fail on missing dependency
desc: Currently we only require one 3rd-party library (HPricot) and maintain a second branch "no-hpricot" that excludes services that require it. This is annoying and not a good programming practice. It would be best if "require tinyback/services" woudld only load services for which all 3rd-party libraries are installed instead of trying to load all services and failing if a single 3rd-party library is missing.
